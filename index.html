            <h2>How <em>FKN PHIL</em> got online!</h2>

        <main>
            <h3>Where and when it all started</h3>
            <p>COVID-19 <img src="covid19.png" alt="covid 19" width="810" height="374"> became a global pandemic in 2020, and reached Newfoundland on March 13, 2020.  
                Newfoundland and the World went into lock down.  All non-essential businesses were 
                ordered to close and all recreational facilities were ordered to close.  This left
                <b>FKN PHIL</b> home with his daughter, <i>Emma</i>, for the remainder of 2020.
            </p>
            <p>As most of the world did, so did <b>FKN PHIL</b>, he went online.<img src="online.jpg" alt="picture of a laptop" Width="960" height="540">
                He dusted off his social media accounts and reconnected with 1 of his older passions, Poker.  He made a deposit
                of $100 onto Pokerstars and he was ready to play.  However, as he quickly found out, 
                poker seemed to have changed.  It wasn't like he remembered in 2005 or 2007 when he 
                was on a poker cruise based in <em>Italy</em>.  As he now found himself playing a game that
                he didnt have an edge in, he decided to look for answers.
            </p>
            <div style="border: 1px solid black">
            <h5>Download Poker Stars here:</h5>
            <form>

            </form>
            </div>
            <p>His quest for answers led him to many youtube channels, where poker training videos 
                and discussions could be found quite abundantly.  But it also led him to <em>Evan Jarvis</em>
                has a poker community and training packages he offers for free.  FKN PHIL quickly
                started taking his training and joined the gripsed community.  This new community 
                led him to twitch.<img src="twitch.png" alt="twitch logo">
            </p>
            <div style="border: 1px solid black">
            <p>Twitch is an American video live streaming service that focuses on video game live 
                streaming, including broadcasts of esports competitions. In addition, it offers 
                music broadcasts, creative content, and more recently, "in real life" streams.
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>Knowing that Emma had been wanting to have her own youtube channel, FKN PHIL decided
                to buy a new computer system, and become a streamer himself so he would know what to 
                do for his daughter.  He researched into what level of computer would be needed and 
                what other hardware that is required to stream successfully.
            </p>

            <h3>The Resources Needed to get online</h3>
            <h4>CAMERA</h4><img src="webcam.jpg" alt="Logitech C922">
            <p>One of the 4 core components of any stream.  FKN PHIL uses a 1080p digital camera for 
                his stream.  The web cam in your laptop or even the camera in your phone could be 
                used as well. <blockquote cite="https://restream.io/blog/best-webcams/">The Logitech C922 is the top used camera by streamers today.</blockquote>
            </p>
            <h4>MICROPHONE</h4><img src="micro.jpg" alt="microphone">
            <p>Having a high quality microphone is one of the most important pieces of hardware for 
                your stream.  FKN PHIL uses a condenser microphone on a swing arm for mobility.
            </p>
            <h4>STREAMING SOFTWARE</h4><img src="stream.jpg" alt="Stream Elements">
            <p>Also known as Open-Broadcast Software or OBS is needed to capture your inputs and display on stream.
                There are many options but FKN PHIL uses Stream Elements OBS, because he likes the features.
            </p>
            <h4>GOOD INTERNET</h4><img src="good.jpg" alt="internet speedometer">
            <p>Having a good internet connection is paramount to delivering a quality stream to the viewers.
            </p>
            <h5>Lighting</h5>
            <p>Good lighting can be found next to windows or with lights.  FKN PHIL uses 5k lights because 
                they a natural white with a slight tint of yellow.  This color is for ppl who have less 
                natural white light.  
            </p>
            <h5>Green Screen</h5>
            <p>Although not completely needed as there are software options available to chroma key your 
                backgrounds and such.  FKN PHIL uses a green screen to make the processing easier for his system.
            </p>

            <h3>System acquired and then...</h3><video src="video1.mkv" width="320" height="240" controls></video>
            <p>So with all the hardware and computer system acquired FKN PHIL set up his stream.  
                Since he had been playing in the Newfoundland Poker Group on PokerStars,  he 
                decided that he would stream himself playing that game daily.  His initial followers
                came directly from the <abbr title="Newfoundland Poker Tour">NLPT</abbr>, but he was able to piggy back off Gripsed community and 
                gain his followers and get his watch time quickly.  Within 2 weeks FKN PHIL became 
                a twitch affiliate.
            </p>
            <p>And as he streamed everyday, he slowly became more confident and continuously learned new things.  Today he has 300
                followers on Twitch and grew the poker game from just its regular 12 to 14 nightly players to an average of 70+ 
                players.  Now his stream looks like this.<video src="video2.mkv" width="320" height="240" controls></video>
            </p>
            <p>Currently attending an Accelerated Software Development course, poker and his stream have been put on hold, 
                as he remains laser focused on being the top student in his class.  
            </p>
